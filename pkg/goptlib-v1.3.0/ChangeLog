== v1.3.0

Added a DialOrWithDialer function that allows you to, for example, use a
specific source address when dialing the ORPort.

== v1.2.0

The default and development branch is now "main" rather than "master".
The master branch will no longer be updated.
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/anti-censorship-team/2021-May/000168.html
If you have an existing clone of the master branch, run these commands
to update it:
	git fetch origin
	git remote set-head origin -a
	git branch --move master main
	git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

Added a go.mod file.

== 0.7

Fixed the ProxyError function; previously it would always panic.

Repeated transport names in TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR now result in an
ENV-ERROR.
https://bugs.torproject.org/21261

== 0.6

Remove all support for the "*" transport specification. The argument to
the ClientSetup and ServerSetup functions is now unused.
https://bugs.torproject.org/15612

Replaced SOCKS4a with SOCKS5.
https://bugs.torproject.org/12535

== 0.5

The AcceptSocks function no longer reports non-permanent errors, such as
those caused by a faulty SOCKS handshake.

Added support for an upstream proxy (TOR_PT_PROXY). The two new
functions are ProxyError and ProxyDone. The ClientInfo struct has a new
ProxyURL member.
https://bugs.torproject.org/12125

== 0.4

Read the ExtORPort cookie file on every call to DialOr, instead of
reading it once and caching the result. This is to work around a tor bug
where tor doesn't ensure a new cookie file is written before starting
pluggable transports.
https://bugs.torproject.org/15240

== 0.3

Made output functions panic intead of backslash-escaping. Escaping of
invalid bytes is not specified by pt-spec, and backslashes conflicted
with the specified escaping of SMETHOD ARGS.
https://bugs.torproject.org/13370

== 0.2

Added the MakeStateDir function.

== 0.1
== 0.0

Initial release.
